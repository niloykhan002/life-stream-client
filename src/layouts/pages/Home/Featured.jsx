              Though Bangladesh has more than 160 million people, the number of
              safe blood bank is very few. Without divisional towns, there is
              hardly any blood bank. But a huge amount of blood is needed for
              treatment purposes. A good number of accidents take place every
              day where blood needs essentially. As a result, people fall in
              real trouble to manage blood. But there are many blood donors who
              are interested in donating blood but donâ€™t know who needs blood.
              The communication gap is resulting in the loss of many lives.
